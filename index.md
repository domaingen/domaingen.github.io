title: What do we need for successful domain generalization?
---
---

## Workshop description

The real challenge for any machine learning system is to be reliable and robust in any situation, even if it is different compared to training conditions. Existing general purpose approaches to domain generalization (DG) &mdash; a problem setting that challenges a model to generalize well to data outside the distribution sampled at training time &mdash; have failed to consistently outperform standard empirical risk minimization baselines. In this workshop, we aim to work towards answering a single question: <em>what do we need for successful domain generalization?</em> We conjecture that additional information of some form is required for a general purpose learning methods to be successful in the DG setting. The purpose of this workshop is to identify possible sources of such information, and demonstrate how these extra sources of data can be leveraged to construct models that are robust to distribution shift. Specific topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

* Leveraging domain-level meta-data 
* Exploiting multiple modalities to achieve robustness to distribution shift 
* Frameworks for specifying known invariances/domain knowledge 
* Causal modeling and how it can be robust to distribution shift  
* Empirical analysis of existing domain generalization methods and their underlying assumptions     
* Theoretical investigations into the domain generalization problem and potential solutions

<!-- **General:** -->

<!-- To watch the workshop: the event is live streamed via the [ICLR workshop page](https://iclr.cc/virtual/2022/workshop/4550)
Please do not join the Zoom room unless you are an author participating in the Q&A period for your session.

Asking questions during a Q&A or panel discussion: please ask via [Rocket Chat](https://iclr.cc/virtual/2022/workshop/4550) or our [workshop Slack channel](https://join.slack.com/t/ai4earth/shared_invite/zt-170eobxsl-CBO8BVlUqqfOjsNj1ij7NA). Session moderators will be continually looking for questions from the audience and relaying them to speakers.

Poster session: [join the Gathertown poster room](https://app.gather.town/app/I1tkF58IbTcXKvMm/ai4ess-poster-session). Note: you will need to navigate either to the poster session (to see posters) or the breakout room (meet and chat with other workshop participants).

Breakout rooms: after each session, there will be a [GatherTown breakout room](https://app.gather.town/y9ohC8zQBrN4tQMt/iclr2022-workshop-room-10) where you can meet, chat, and network with other participants who attended your the session. We heartily encourage you to check out your session's breakout room after the Q&A.  -->
