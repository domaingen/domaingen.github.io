## Tentative Schedule

Due to the virtual nature of the workshop, we are able to extend the duration of the event to span several time zones. We will split the contributed talks and poster presentations into two blocks, with one intended primarily for those attending from a time zone with a negative UTC offset (e.g., the Americas), and the other for those attending from a positive UTC offset (e.g., Asia). We will hold the main invited talks and panel discussion between these two blocks, thus maximizing the potential audience. We will investigate whether this schedule needs to be adapted due to, e.g., disproportionate submissions from similar time zones.
